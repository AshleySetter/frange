# frange
Data type for efficiently storing large arrays of equally separated data in python, similar to range but for floats.

This is a simple package containing a class which can be used in a similar manner to the built-in range function in python. It can be used to create a generator or a numpy array containing the desired, equally seperated, values.

It generates numbers in the same manner as numpy's arange function.
